# HeartDiseaseDetectionUsingKNN
heart disease detection using K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm

**Project as a part of Data And Knowledge Management Course at University of Waterloo**

**Feature descriptions**:
Below is the group of features presents in the dataset segregated by their type (numerical, categorical, ordinal, binary)
**_Binary_**
sex (0 = female; 1 = male)
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
exang: Exercise induced angina (0 = no; 1 = yes)
**Categorical**__
cp: Chest pain type (0 = Asymptomatic angina; 1 = Atypical angina; 2 = Non-angina; 3 = Typical angina)
restecg: Resting ECG (0 = Left ventricular hypertrophy; 1 = Normal; 2 = ST-T wave abnormality)
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = downsloping; 1 = upsloping; 2 = flat)
thal: Thalium stress test result (0 = NA; 1 = Fixed defect; 2 = Normal; 3 = Reversible defect)
**Ordinal**__
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
**Numeric**__
age
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
trestbps: Resting blood pressure
chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved during thalium stress test
**Target**__
target: 1 = heart disease; 0 = no heart disease
